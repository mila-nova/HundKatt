## Project Description  

### Website Project Plan
Name: Petshop  
Customer: Learning project  
Type: Web Store Presentation  
#### About
Instead of creating a project based on a non-existent client, I decided to look for an existing online store that has a non-functioning and neglected website to see what I can do to help.

I wanted to create a reworked version of website for my cat's local store. Their website is not working properly and that they use their FB page as the main resource. I want my cat to have all the best in his life and this project would be very fun and good learning experience. 
Their website is intended as a presentation for their services. They do not actually sell online. This is a perfect opportunity for me as it means I don't have to work with backend and can focus only on creating a frontend shell. I want to make the website easy to use and understand, and I want my solution and design to represent genuine care for the customer and their animals.

#### Purpose
The purpose of the online store is to encourage visitors to visit the store and become customers of the company. This is done by positioning the company as a reliable and experienced service provider in the local district for the target market.
Visitors will preview potential services and offers by viewing their website before making any visits or phone calls. 
#### Target group
The Petshop has pet owners as general customers. Small pet stores such as this one choose to market to customers in the local area. Their target group is people who live nearby and have cats, dogs and small animals and are looking for a comfortable and easily accessible store to provide for their pets.
#### Functionality
Website features are to give customers the general idea of store selection and provide information about the store.
#### Visual focus
Design and visual information is focused on conveying the cozy feeling of love for pets, trust and family spirit, showing genuine care for pets and their owners' concerns.
#### Interactivity
The site structure plans to be easy to use, responsive and have clean navigation. Current offers are planned to be represented by colorful banners. Integration of the store's facebook page is expected.
#### Products and services
The website contains a range of pet food and accessories, has information on offers, customer club and offers the possibility to subscribe to newsletters.

### Original Website Assessment
Website is hosted on one.com. The site was created with a built-in visual editor by one.com.
Among the biggest problems I encountered on the site are:  
+ It lacks consistency in appearance. It lacks any design or 'image' in general.
+ Absence of brand color or specified font
+ It lacks structure. Information is presented without order
+ Deforming, warping of media
+ The site feels outdated and unformatted without style
+ Lack of SSL certificate even though one.com provides it.
+ The subscription service does not work.  
The only thing that visually works well is the menu. It works responsively.
